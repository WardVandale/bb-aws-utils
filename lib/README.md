# `bb-aws-utils`: A `bash` library for CI/CD

## Introduction

This library contains multiple modules that each cover a specific domain. These
modules are designed in a way that there is no dependency between the modules to
allow them to be used in as much as possible projects and environments.

## Best practices using the library

* Never put sensitive information in the pipeline configuration file. Usernames, passwords, hostnames
  and other pieces of information that might be abused should be defined as a (secret) property of
  the repository (i.e. _Repository variables_ in _BitBucket_)
* The AWS credentials should have exactly the permissions for the task they are used for
* Better create a separate user for each AWS task

## Let's start with an example

The example features a project written in Java, build using `maven` and deployed to
AWS ECS, and the code live in a _BitBucket_ repository, and the CI/CD is performed
by _BitBucket Pipelines_.

The `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` file that performs a snapshot build on a commit on `develop`, and
a deploy to a AWS ECS `tst` environment looks like this:

```yaml
pipelines:
  branches:
    develop:
      - step:
          name: Snapshot build
          image: atlassian/default-image:2
          caches:
            - maven
          script:
            - git clone -b ${BB_AWS_UTILS_VERSION} https://github.com/rik2803/bb-aws-utils.git
            - export LIB_DIR="./bb-aws-utils/lib"
            - source bb-aws-utils/lib/load.bash
            - maven_build
          artifacts:
            - artifacts/**
      - step:
          name: Deploy snapshot build to tst
          image: atlassian/pipelines-awscli:latest
          script:
            - git clone -b ${BB_AWS_UTILS_VERSION} https://github.com/rik2803/bb-aws-utils.git
            - export LIB_DIR="./bb-aws-utils/lib"
            - source bb-aws-utils/lib/load.bash
            - export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=${AWS_ECS_ACCESS_KEY_ID_TST}
            - export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="${AWS_ECS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY_TST}"
            - echo "The next command sets the envvar MAVEN_CURRENT_VERSION"
            - maven_get_current_version
            - >
              aws_update_service ${AWS_ECS_CLUSTER_NAME_TST}
              ${AWS_ECS_SERVICE_NAME} ${AWS_ECS_TASK_FAMILY}
              ${MAVEN_CURRENT_SNAPSHOT_VERSION} myorg/${AWS_ECS_TASK_FAMILY}

options:
  docker: true
```

To load the library, following three lines are always required:

```yaml
            - git clone -b ${BB_AWS_UTILS_VERSION} https://github.com/rik2803/bb-aws-utils.git
            - export LIB_DIR="./bb-aws-utils/lib"
            - source bb-aws-utils/lib/load.bash
```

The environment variable `${BB_AWS_UTILS_VERSION}` specifies the version of the library to use. Check
the `RELEASES.md` file for available versions and the changes. If not specified (i.e. if the command is
`git clone https://github.com/rik2803/bb-aws-utils.git`), the `master` branch will be used.

To perform a _Maven_ build, these functions are available:


* `maven_build`
* `maven_release_build`

* `maven_deploy`
* `maven_release_deploy`

To determine the version to deploy, use the function `maven_get_current_versions` to
set the environment variables `MAVEN_CURRENT_RELEASE_VERSION` and
`MAVEN_CURRENT_SNAPSHOT_VERSION`. These envvars can be used to pass to the commands that
take care of the deploy of your artifact.

| `MAVEN_SETTINGS_PATH`            | no  | Path where `settings.xml` should be                       | `/`                                 |
| `MAVEN_MINOR_BUMP_STRING`        | no  | String to determine if minor version is bumped            | `bump_minor_version`                |

| `DEVELOPMENT_VERSION_OVERRIDE`   | no  | Override the default snapshot version determined by maven | Only used in `maven_release_deploy` |

### Generate the `settings.xml` file

The `settings.xml` file should never be part of the repository for the same reason you don't put
usernames and passwords in a _POM_ file. Therefor, the file should be generated, getting the
required information from the environment, set by the repository hosting company from settings
you enter. Always remember to make passwords and other sensitive information _Secret_ so the
values are not accessible or logged in the build or deploy log.

The `settings.xml` file is generated from these 3 environment variables:

* `MAVEN_SETTINGS_ID`: Space separated string af _Id_'s
* `MAVEN_SETTINGS_USERNAME`: Space separated string of usernames
* `MAVEN_SETTINGS_PASSWORD`: Space separated string of passwords (**SECRET!!!**)
* `MAVEN_SETTINGS_EMAIL`: Space separated string of e-mail addresses

The number of elements in each of these variables should be identical. If the e-mail address for
a _server_ is not required, use the value `NA` to keep the elements aligned.

### Perform a snapshot build

The function `maven_build` performs a snapshot build. The default phases are `clean deploy`, but
can be overridden by setting the environment variable `MAVEN_DEVELOP_COMMAND`.

At the end of the function, if everything was successful, a script `artifacts/MAVEN_CURRENT_VERSION`
is created for use in the next steps (a deploy step, for example).

### Perform a release build

**WARNING**: A release build is always performed on the `HEAD` of the branch specified
by `MAVEN_BRANCH` (defaults to `master`). This is required because a _Maven_ release needs
to perform 2 commits (`pom.xml` update for release build and `pom.xml` update for the next
development release preparation).

The function `maven_release_build` performs a release build. The default phases are
`release:prepare release:perform`, but can be overridden by setting the environment variable
`MAVEN_RELEASE_COMMAND`.

At the end of the function, if everything was successful, a script `artifacts/MAVEN_CURRENT_VERSION`
is created for use in the next steps (a deploy step, for example).

The version of the release and the version of the next snapshot are determined like this:

* Given the current version in `pom.xml` is `M.m.p-SNAPSHOT`
* If the last commit message contains the string defined in the environment variable
  `MAVEN_MINOR_BUMP_STRING` (default value is `bump_minor_version`)
  * The release version becomes `M.m+1.0`
  * The new snapshot version becomes `M.m+1.1-SNAPSHOT`
* If the last commit message **does not** contain the bump string
  * The release version becomes `M.m.p`
  * The new snapshot version becomes `M.m.p+1-SNAPSHOT`

### Determine the *current* version

The function `maven_get_current-version` will set the required environment variables, if
possible, and will fail the deploy if an error occurs. The function should be called
explicitely in the pipeline.

* `MAVEN_CURRENT_RELEASE_VERSION`: The release version that was build by this pipeline run.
* `MAVEN_CURRENT_SNAPSHOT_VERSION`: The snapshot version that was prepared by
  this pipeline run.

In a CI/CD setup, where no _human intervention_ should be required, all steps have to be
designed to run automatically and without providing input to the pipeline (OK, a push of a
button to start a production deploy is the only exception).

Every step of the build pipeline runs on a given commit. The `pom.xml` file of that commit
contains a snapshot version, the new (release and snapshot) versions are calculated as part
of the build and passed to _Maven_ on the commandline.

Since the deploys are in different steps of the pipeline (you should be able to re-run these
steps in case of a failure without having to re-build), there should be a way to pass the
version to deploy from the build step to the deploy steps.

How can this be accomplished?

#### Using _BitBucket_ artifacts

A file is created during the build phase. This file contains shell commands to set environment
variables that contain the release and snapshot version. During the deploy phase, this file
can be sources and the variables can be used to trigger the deploy of the desired version.

All good so far, but there is a _but_. _BitBucket_ only keeps artifacts for 7 days. Starting
a deploy mare than seven days after the build will cause the version not to be available.

There should be a fall-back options if this occurs.

#### Using a repository variables

When the artifact is not available, the repository variable `MAVEN_CURRENT_RELEASE_VERSION`
will be used. If the variable does not exist, the deploy will fail with a clear message.

#### *TODO* Store the information in a DynamoDB table

This could serve as an alternative for the repository variable workaround, and offers a
stable and seamless solution for the problem.

The table will have the commit hash as the partition key and the project name as the
sort key, and will store this during the build, together with:

* Release version
* Snapshot version
* Metadata (optional)
  * Build date
  * Deploy information
  * ...

When deploying, the record is retrieved using commit hash and project name.

### Update property version

The function `maven_update_property_version` will update the artifact which version is defined by a given property. This uses behind the scenes the [update-property](https://www.mojohaus.org/versions/versions-maven-plugin/update-property-mojo.html) goal of the [versions](https://www.mojohaus.org/versions/versions-maven-plugin/index.html) maven plugin.

* `NEW_VERSION`: The desired version of the artifact. The version should always be higher than the current version. Value `latest` will update the artifact to the latest available version. 
* `VERSION_PROPERTY`: The property that denotes the version of the desired artifact.

The function will export the environment variables: 
* `ORIGINAL_VERSION`: The original version of the artifact
* `NEW_VERSION`: The new version of the artifact


### Update parent version

The function `maven_update_parent_version` performs an of update the parent of the maven project. This uses behind the scenes the [update-parent](https://www.mojohaus.org/versions/versions-maven-plugin/update-parent-mojo.html) goal of the [versions](https://www.mojohaus.org/versions/versions-maven-plugin/index.html) maven plugin.

* `NEW_VERSION`: The desired version of the parent. Value `latest` will update the artifact to the latest available version.

The function will export the environment variables:
* `ORIGINAL_VERSION`: The original version of the parent
* `NEW_VERSION`: The new version of the parent
* `PARENT_ARTIFACT_ID`: The artifact id of the parent



## The `aws` module

### Overview of environment variables used in the `maven` module

| Variable name           | Req?| Description     | Default                 |
|-------------------------|-----|-----------------|-------------------------|
| `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`    | no  | AWS Region      | `eu-west-1` (Frankfurt) |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`     | yes | AWS Credentials |                         |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | yes | AWS Credentials |                         |

The user whose AWS Credentials are used, should have enough (but not too much)
rights to perform the AWS related tasks for which the credentials are used.

### Update an ECS service

The function `aws_update_service` can be used to update an existing AWS ECS service with
the Docker artifact that is available in a Docker image repository.

The command needs a number of arguments:

| Argument name           | Description                                            | Example                    |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| `aws_ecs_cluster_name ` | Name of the ECS cluster where the service is running   | `MyCluster`                |
| `aws_ecs_task_family `  | The ECS task family                                    | `example-service`          |
| `aws_ecs_service_name ` | The ECS service name                                   | `example-service`          |
| `image_tag `            | The Docker image tag to run                            | `0.0.7`                    |
| `image_basename `       | The Docker image basename (everything without the tag) | `ixortalk/example-service` |
